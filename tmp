- Setup and basic create-react-app boilerplate

* Reinstall prettier, had some weird clash so I uninstalled the entire package 

* Components get uppercase names 
* data-test-id for the react testing library

TODO -
* Normalize gets rid of all the browser-set padding and margins etc. 
* BEM - block, element, modifier

Some styling issues on the AddTask dropdown

Check for console logs

Idea for improvement - make the pizza a pop-up with a colour to choose instead of just light/dark mode 

Add test coverage command to README? (I've installed it but couldn't get it to run) Use npm not yarn

Do more research into jest mocks

check for skipped tests

------

Clicking off the quick add task dropdown doesn't close it - fix this?


############# TESTS
Checkbox ❌
* 2 failures
* "TypeError: Cannot read property 'collection' of undefined"
* Some kind of firebase issue 
  * Need to put a || {} somewhere?

App ✅
* Passing but "A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited. This is likely caused by tests leaking due to improper teardown. Try running with --detectOpenHandles to find leaks. Active timers can also cause this, ensure that .unref() was called on them."

Do you need to add a doc-id to all your projects??
